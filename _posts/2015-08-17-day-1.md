#### 45 Days of Awesomeness  

**Physical Fitness and Computer Science**  

I am following a 45 day fitness regiment and I thought I should spice things up a bit by adding an hour of coding practice on top of this. That means coding up my own data structures and algorithms in C++ / CUDA. Once I have 45 hours of general applied data structures and algorithms in C++ down, I can branch out and tackle a big project. It might not be a bad idea to go through the features of C++ for the first few days so I can cover some of the basics of classes, templates, and inheritance that I might not have gone over in depth before.

I have 9 weeks of rigorous self improvement ahead of me. At least two hours a day on physical fitness and coding, equal parts both. If I can't fit two hours for self-improvement into my schedule my priorities need to be reconsidered.

I used my exercise bike for 15 minutes today. I almost got up to 4 miles during that time, but I decided to just go by the schedule below:

| Day 1 | Day 2     |Day 3 | Day 4 |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
|  15 min Bike | 15 min Bike       | 15 min Bike | 15 min Bike       |
| Fullbody Stretch | Fullbody Stretch |  Fullbody Stretch | Fullbody Stretch |
|  | 50 Pushups | 50 Pushups | 50 Pushups |
| 10 Rollouts | 50 Rollouts | 50 Rollouts | 50 Rollouts |
| 50 Jumping Jacks | 50 Jumping Jacks | 50 Jumping Jacks | 50 Jumping Jacks |
| 25 Squats | 100 Squats | 100 Squats | 100 Squats |
| | 1 hour coding | 1 hour coding | 1 hour coding |

- ~~15 minutes on bike~~
