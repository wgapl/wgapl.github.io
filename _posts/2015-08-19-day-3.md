**WEDNESDAY**  

- ~~15 min bike~~
- ~~40 squats~~
- ~~20 rollouts~~
- ~~15 pushups~~

Wrote a simple `merge_sorted` function in Python. Starting to piece together what it is I want to accomplish over the next 45 days that is completely within my control.

If I say, "I'm going to find a job in the next 45 days!", I might be right, but that isn't the point of this planning exercise. Whatever else I do over the next 42 days, getting into better physical and mental conditioning through practice and exercises is going to benefit me for a very long time to come.
