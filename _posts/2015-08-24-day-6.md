I heard back from Curalate that I'm not worthy and they don't want to hire me. The thing that sucked about the interview was that I really felt like I did okay. That had more to do with the interviewer being polite than it did with me actually knowing the things that I was supposed to know. The fact that my prime number algorithm was sub-par didn't help me either, but oh well. I am fucking done with this shit. I hate all of these bullshit little questions I get asked. I know I am supposed to go through all of the problems on Codility before I apply to another job since my resume actually looks pretty good, but I don't want to practice for these petty problems. I have bigger fish to fry.

I have to get to work on figuring out how to reverse the direction of computation on the [LRCN](http://jeffdonahue.com/lrcn/) network I trained using `batch_size: 50` to fit the training samples onto my GTX 970 with 4 GiB of memory.

On another note, I was actually able to catch some problems with netcdf tarballs not being in their appointed location when building [proteus](https://github.com/erdc-cm/proteus) and the changes I made in my PR to [hashstack](https://github.com/erdc-cm/hashstack) were merged! I'm a real developer now!
