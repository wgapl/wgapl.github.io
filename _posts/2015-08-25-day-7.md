I am working on resolving merge conflicts between my branch of `caffe:master` and `BVLC:caffe:master`. I want to merge `recurrent` into the `master` after that, but I'm learning about resolving merge conflicts slowly.

Apparently I am supposed to use a text editor if I am using the command line. I was wondering what those `<<<<<<<HEAD` strings were all about. :grimacing:  
I'm learning about all of this on an  [article ](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/) on Github.

I really love sharing the things I am doing during the course of the day and links to pages that are important to me right now. I actually took some time today to work on my profile page on [careers.stackoverflow.com](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/optical_anathema).

There are probably a lot of things I shouldn't blog about on a site I am probably going to have visible to potential clients and employers, but a part of me just doesn't really give a fuck.

I live in Washington State, so I smoke a lot of weed and I don't feel like keeping it a secret. There. :trollface:
