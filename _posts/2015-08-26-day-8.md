I interviewed with the hiring manager at CDK Global about their Senior Data Scientist position. I felt like I was getting grilled a little harder about my experience than I would have been if I had just applied for the Data Scientist position, but it has also been my experience that there is no such thing as a Junior Data Scientist. Those entry-level positions are all reserved for Data Analysts.  

I really need to get on track with my Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analysis. I just feel like the whole thing is more Mickey Mouse than what I am already bringing to the table. I should feel that way because it is true, but oh well. I really should get busy and finish the thing in a few months so I can say I completed it even if I don't feel like it will teach me anything that new.  

I also feel like I need to have more shippable products under my belt to make my company that much more legitimate. Starting an applied physics lab is a bold move and I know that it won't be too long before  I offer a robot I have programmed and built on the market.
