I have a phone interview with RootMetrics for a research scientist position tomorrow. I'm not going to worry about it since what I really want to do is grow plants for money and do research for fun with the profits.

What do I want to research?  
**Aging, Robotics, and Nuclear Fusion.**  

I really need to do more coding exercises aside from just talking about coding more. *DO IT!*  

What happened to this guy?  
```
... Once I have 45 hours of general applied data structures and algorithms in C++ down,...
```
Did I forget? What's wrong with me! Focus man! I haven't done any *real* coding all week! These fucking interviews are making my life miserable.

Okay. Here's the deal. It is almost 18:00 right now. Why don't I spend 19:00-20:00 studying some data structure and coding up a small sample that uses it in C++? Good! Now go!
