**SATURDAY**  

- ~~15 minutes bike~~
- ~~stretch~~
- ~~interviewed w/ rootmetrics~~

I thought the interview with RootMetrics went alright. It did leave me wishing I had more recent research experience. Hard to explain why I have been focusing more on building my basic skills in software development.  

I think I was a little hard on myself in my post yesterday. I've been learning about `git` and expanding upon the work I have already done to get the code to work on my system. I do agree I should not disregard the fact that I need more experience building basic data structures with C and C++, but I stay fucking busy. That was never in question.
