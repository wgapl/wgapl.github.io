**WEDNESDAY**  

- ~~15 minutes bike~~
- ~~60 squats~~
- ~~30 lunges (both sides)~~
- ~~30 rollouts~~  

The reason there isn't a Day 11 is that the power went out and I didn't feel like getting all sweaty without being able to take a hot shower afterwards. I did work out more on Day 12 to compensate however, so I am definitely still on track.

I started collaborating with [Vikash](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vikash/) of the Motion Control Lab at the UW yesterday. I'm looking into the `MJCF` file format and thinking of what object I am going to model.
