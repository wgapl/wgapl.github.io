**TUESDAY**

- ~~60 minutes walking~~

I've been nursing a sore left arm lately, so I decided to take it easy on myself today after getting in such a long hike to and from my car at the UW. I walked four miles easily and got a really good workout walking up and down all the hills.

I'm going to be reading and duplicating the results of the Simultaneous Tracking and Calibration ([STAC](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/WuHumanoids13.pdf)) as a first step into participating in the research of the Motion Control Lab. I have a good bit of experience with Systems Identification so the project should be a good fit for me.
