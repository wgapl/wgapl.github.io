**WEDNESDAY**

- ~~15 minutes bike~~
- ~~100 squats~~
- ~~10 pushups~~
- ~~10 rollouts~~
- ~~stretch~~

I have been going over the code in `mjhaptix120/apicpp/grasp.cpp` and it has been giving me a lot of confidence in my ability to code in C and C++. I am pretty sure I understand pointers in my sleep now! That aside, I've been having a lot of fun getting more familiar with all of the material on robotics that has been on the periphery of my consciousness. I feel great!
