**MONDAY**

- ~~25 minutes bike~~
- ~~6 rollouts~~
- ~~5 pushups~~

I started working with the Matlab MuJoCo wrapper and I am enjoying myself thus far. I can see just what kind of higher level functionality should be included to make the Python API work better. The work I did this weekend was all important, as any further improvements to `mujoco.py` I make are going to probably be a part of another file that will make it to where I can type
```Python
import mujoco as mj
from time import sleep

# Set up delay so loop proceeds in real time
n_sec = 10
n_steps = 5000
delay = n_sec / n_steps

# Load mjcf model
mj.loadmodel('./hand.xml')

# Step forward and show results in real time
for k in range(n_steps):
    mj.step()
    sleep(delay)
    mj.plot()
```
and it will do the same thing as a Matlab file that says
``` Matlab
% Set up delay so loop proceeds in real time
n_sec = 10;
n_steps = 5000;
delay = n_sec / n_steps;

% Load mjcf model
mj load hand.xml

for j=1:n_steps
  mj step
  pause(delay)
  mj plot
end
```
