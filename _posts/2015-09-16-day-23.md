- ~~20 minutes bike~~
- ~~60 squats~~
- ~~60 jumping jacks~~
- ~~10 pushups (5 normal, 5 assisted)~~
- ~~10 rollouts~~

I've been letting a sore left shoulder strengthen up. I haven't been focusing enough on my shoulders and their mobility. I just did the stretch where ones elbows stick out away from the torso while rotating the shoulder joint along the major axis of the upper arm between +/- 90 degrees.
