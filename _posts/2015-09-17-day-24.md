**THURSDAY**

I didn't work out today because I spent the whole latter half of the day Wednesday thinking about vertical hydroponics and didn't go to sleep. So Thursday was weird because it didn't really happen in terms of my on-off cycles of consciousness. The good news is that I am confident I can fit at least 2000 plants in the garage. I wish I owned my own home on around 10 acres in the middle of nowhere. Then the 60' X 100' metal buildings would start to sprout up like mushrooms. I would stop after building the second one and spend a little bit more on the third, fourth, and so forth by digging a 60 foot hole in the ground and using the metal building as a roof. Then for the foot space of a single building, we could have four to six times the crop production potential by having an effective 60' X 100' X 56' building. Vertical farming!

Looking at the cost to dig a 60' wide by 100' long X 60' deep hole makes me think it would be far more economical to simply buy the equipment necessary to run a construction company before paying someone else to undertake such an effort.
