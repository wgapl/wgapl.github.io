**TUESDAY**

- ~~15 minutes bike~~
- ~~mowed yard~~
- ~~cleared out garage~~

I'm working on duplicating the work on Simultaneous Tracking and Calibration(STAC) done by the Motion Control Lab at the UW. So far it is all moving along quite well. My biggest challenges up to this point have been just reading up on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) as I prepare to implement them for the STAC
