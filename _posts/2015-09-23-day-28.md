**WEDNESDAY**

Today wasn't the day for exercise. I'm going to work out Monday-Tuesday, break Wednesday, then exercise again Thursday-Friday. I'll keep this up for a few weeks before switching to working out Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday. I'll keep that up a while before starting to include Saturday workouts into my schedule.

Even if I haven't seen the phenomenal gains I wanted to see during the first two thirds of this 45 day plan, undertaking the effort to document what I am doing and to keep with has been a tremendous success. I'm about 15 lbs lighter than I was when I started, but that doesn't really say much because I am sure I have built up some muscle (and therefore "gained weight") over the past almost four weeks. The thing to focus on is the routine. I've stuck with it over this time despite some setbacks. I don't go more than a couple of days without some exercise anymore, and I feel really good about that. Of course I am going to have to ratchet up the amount of time I spend working out so I will lose weight more quickly, but establishing the regular habit of working is a critical first step.

Maybe I can start to include more salads in my diet and carry around a big bottle of filtered water with me to encourage me to drink more water and less soda.
