I built a workbench today. It is level and stable! Made by my own two hands with the help of a bunch of electric power tools. :smile:

I built a bench because the work benches I saw for sale were either way overpriced or incredibly rinky dink, and I have an $80 drill press I need to be able to put up appropriately. I might take 4" off the legs since the bench is pretty tall right now. The top is about 45" off the ground. I used a 2' X 4' piece of 3/4" MDF as the top because it was cheap and thick. The design was inspired by a picture that goes along with the metal corner connectors. When I saw the image I decided I could build one with my limited carpentry skills.

So anyway, the reason I now have a bench and a bench drill press that is supposed to be here by the 30th of September because I am going to build the G-Tower vertical hydroponic planter seen below. I plan on building several actually.

Here's my plan for the garage.

So I'm planning for 100 towers right now. I should be able to include a few more once I get everything settled, but this is the general idea as of right now. I need more lumber, but the first two boards of the first scaffold are already in place.
