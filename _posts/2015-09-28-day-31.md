**MONDAY**

- ~~45 minutes walking~~

I met with Vikash today. I got behind schedule, but not too far behind schedule. He wants to work together closely. More closely than anyone I've ever really worked with actually. I might actually make some friends if I'm around people more than once a week. It is going to take me a minute to get used to it, but I don't think it is a bad idea to completely throw myself into this opportunity at all. It feels like I am going to be looked at for a staff position if I am successful enough to publish a paper or two, and if they won't give me one I will certainly be able to use any success in the lab to launch my robotics career along whichever path it may take.

I can be of real use to a robotics lab with my skills if I put my mind to it, and I am putting my mind to this. I am going to treat it like the job it is probably going to become.

So I was sitting here writing down my thoughts on a piece of paper when I need to be putting it on my blog.

###PLAN FOR TOMORRROW -- 29 Sep 2015
- Read "...sensor fusion..." paper
- Install Windows on desktop or other laptop (_sigh_)
