**TUESDAY**

- ~~60 squats~~
- ~~10 rollouts~~
- ~~10 assisted pushups~~
- ~~stretch~~

I started working up another toy stac in matlab. I still didn't use MuJoCo to do shit since I was only using simple rotary joints and letting `lsqnonlin` calculate the jacobian numerically. I couldn't get it to work with seven parameters and a non-normalized set of joint angles as the trajectory.
