**WEDNESDAY**

- ~~15 minutes bike~~
- ~~10 assisted pushups~~

I got the toy STAC in Matlab working today. It took me most of the damn day to get it to work, but I finally ironed out all the kinks by reducing the dimension of the system and the number of points I was using as a sample. I changed the maximum number of iterations as well as the tolerance to allow the method of converge quickly to the correct set of parameters.

I'm going in to the campus tomorrow. I think I might stay a little later in the day. Maybe I can figure out a quick and easy way to make my way over to Pike Market for some more of that delicious cajun chicken sausage. Those hot links I made were the fucking bomb. Who knew the best damn BBQ I would ever eat would be something I made myself with ingredients I purchased in Seattle.
