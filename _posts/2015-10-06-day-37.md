**TUESDAY**  

I did a lot of walking to and from the campus yesterday, but that doesn't really count. Ever since I figured I shouldn't walk down to 45th then over to University Ave, the walk to the CSE building isn't really that strenuous.

I'm going in tomorrow afternoon to get some work done duplicating the results of STAC and the Sensor Fusion paper. I am pretty sure I am going to sign up for underactuated robotics on EdX from MITx as well.

It looks like I get a copy of Matlab to use during the course! Sweet. I should focus on this course in tandem with the research I am doing with the Motion Control Lab at the UW. Someday I will make a comfortable living doing what I love. I just need to keep chasing that hope and I will catch up with it eventually.
