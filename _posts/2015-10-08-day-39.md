**THURSDAY**

- ~~5 minutes bike~~

I'm trying to get back in the rhythm of an exercise routine. Volunteering with the motion control lab and having a paper back within my grasps has upset my timing, but I'm getting it all straightened out. These past eight weeks of physical fitness have been great for my body and my psychological health. Despite how I might feel after missing a few days of exercise, I have established a habit. That was the point of the 45 day plan, and in that my mission was a success.

I did end up signing up for a course on underactuated robotics from MITx. I got a copy of Matlab to use for the class that I'm going to end up using for my research as well, so that is good.

As far as I can tell, STAC has been used to calibrate Adroit. Hell, the Adroit model came with the STAC code even if the humanoid hand they used in the paper was the Shadowhand.
