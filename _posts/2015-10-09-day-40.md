**FRIDAY**

- ~~Walked 60 minutes~~

I went to a talk on human-robot dialog. It was very interesting. I also realized that I don't have the newest version of MuJoCo that is needed to parse the Adroit.xml MJCF file I was handed to work with. I've been looking over the code, and it all makes sense. I'm actually pretty good at this computational science stuff. Huh. Imagine that.

I was only trained by some of the best in the field, so it isn't really that much credit to me as it is the fact that I've taken the courses and read the papers.

I'm putting together one of the vertical planters and/or the 5' by 8' tower rack so I can get the commercial garden up and cooking for real.
