**FRIDAY**

- ~~started using my mouse right-handed again~~

I took a week off from working out aside from some a lot of walking Monday and Tuesday along with using my bike and ab wheel Monday before heading in to the lab. I took this break because my left shoulder and arm have been killing me. What started out as a few innocent twitches of my left forearm soon evolved into full-blown pain all across my entire upper left body. Not fun at all. So I quit using my left arm to use my mouse at my desktop and now I feel 100% better with each passing moment. Fucking crazy.

Anyway, I'm behind in my progress with STAC and I'm really ready to start diving into the contact sensor fusion research.

I have to get started with the Computer Vision course soon. I got busy this week with harvesting and going down to Seattle. I can use that momentum to stay busy over the weekend coding up a toy version of the contact sensor fusion algorithm.

I started building the vertical planter.

It feels really good to be able to build something like this after watching a few videos on Youtube.
