I strained my tricep tendon doing pushups about a month ago and I just now figured out what the problem is. I might have ruptured the bastard for all I know. My arm is all kinds of fucked up, basically. I thought the problem was in my shoulder and neck because I was tensing up. Changing my kinematic parameters to make my joints more stiff as a result of the mystery pain.

Anyway, I have to put ice on my left elbow for at least 20 minutes a day for the next I don't know how long. I'm going to follow the instructions on the Live Strong site below:

I had to give up working with the Motion Control Lab to seek gainful employment over the next few months. I am going to read some of their papers on using trajectory optimization in concert with recurrent networks to control humanoid robots.
