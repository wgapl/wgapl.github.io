Research
</h3>

<p>
    Wood Gesellschaft Applied Physics Laboratory is a small private research
    lab which focuses on scalability in science and engineering through open
    source robotics and artificial intelligence.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Robotics</strong>. We are currently interested in multiphysics
        enabled system identification of deformable objects and affordable 3D
        printed contact sensors embedded in synthetic skin for model predictive
        control of humanoid robot manipulators. Human beings interact with our
        environment primarily through our hands, as our feet have mostly been
        used for mobility and support since our ancestors came down out of the
        trees. Duplicating the interactions of humans with their environment is
        therefore in a large part imitating how our hands manipulate objects.
    </li>
<br/>
    <li>
        <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>. We study spatial reasoning for
         intelligent agents as well as question answering systems and artificial
          general intelligence. Strong AI is as important to scalability in
          science as it is to increasing the quality of human life in general.
          Stronger AI will allow our potential work hours to scale roughly with
          the price of electricity instead of being constrained by the size of
          the available human workforce along with countless economic factors.

        Applications
    </h3>
        <p>
            We are interested in developing humanoid manipulators capable
            of performing common horticultural tasks which are still done by hand in
            addition to creating novel indoor vertical gardening technology in the form
            of inexpensive hydroponic towers.
            <!-- As a small private research lab, Wood Gesellschaft Applied Physics
            Laboratory is at a disadvantage in our search for funding from
            traditional sources due to competition from larger, more
            well-established research labs with more broadly defined goals and
            effectively infinitely more man hours to throw at any particular
            task. Because of this handicap in our efforts to compete with larger
             institutions for funding, Wood Gesellschaft Applied Physics
             Laboratory has invested our precious time, resources, and expertise
              in engineering and physics over the last several months to
              advancements in horticulture. -->

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vertical Horticulture.</strong> We have developed low
                     cost vertical horticulture technology because money really
                     does grow on trees. Our vertical hydroponic gardening products
                     allow the output of horticultural operations to scale in size
                     by volume as opposed to area as with traditional gardening
                     methods. We believe this technology will be all important
                     in coming years to avoid any adverse affects of population
                     pressure on food security. Many thanks to

                     for his videos describing his method of constructing
                     vertical towers for indoor hydroponics.

                    <strong>Agricultural Robotics and Automation.</strong> Our
                    research in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence has many
                    applications to the agriculture industry.

                    from Naturipe is a perfect example of how important
                    dexterous robotic manipulation is to scalability in
                    agricultural sciences.<br/>
