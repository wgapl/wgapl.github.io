This is a more close range, often updated list of WG-APL's "TO DO"s.

- Go through the samples that come with the CUDA SDK.
- Get more experience writing software by working on updating the Bullet3 API. (Hint: It has to do with updating the build process)
- Upgrade Bullet API for GazeboSim after exposing the OpenCL GPU capablities of Bullet3 library.
- Reverse the flow of computation in the LRCN network I trained after merging the `recurrent` branch into `master`.
- Keep going with the 45 days plan of ramping up to fitness.  
- Keep blogging here on [wgapl.github.io](https://wgapl.github.io/)
